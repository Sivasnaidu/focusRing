Spatial Navigation Spatial Navigation for Smart TVs This repository contains a robust and intuitive spatial navigation system designed specifically for Smart TV environments. 
Unlike traditional web navigation that relies on mouse pointers or scrollbars, Smart TVs necessitate a navigation paradigm optimized for D-pads and remote controls,
where users traverse focusable elements in a two-dimensional grid.

Why Spatial Navigation for Smart TVs? Smart TV user interfaces (UIs) present unique challenges:

Remote Control Input: Users typically interact using a remote with directional buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) and an "OK" or "Select" button. 
Large Screen Viewing: Content is consumed from a distance, requiring larger, clearly distinguishable focus indicators. 
Grid-Based Layouts: Many Smart TV applications utilize grid-like layouts for content Browse (e.g., app launchers, movie carousels). 
Traditional web navigation models often fall short in this context, leading to frustrating user experiences. 
This PoC aims to provide a solution that feels natural and efficient for TV users.
