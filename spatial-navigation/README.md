Spatial Navigation 
Spatial Navigation for Smart TVs
This repository contains a robust and intuitive spatial navigation system designed specifically for Smart TV environments. Unlike traditional web navigation that relies on mouse pointers or scrollbars, Smart TVs necessitate a navigation paradigm optimized for D-pads and remote controls, where users traverse focusable elements in a two-dimensional grid.

Why Spatial Navigation for Smart TVs?
Smart TV user interfaces (UIs) present unique challenges:

Remote Control Input: Users typically interact using a remote with directional buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) and an "OK" or "Select" button.
Large Screen Viewing: Content is consumed from a distance, requiring larger, clearly distinguishable focus indicators.
Grid-Based Layouts: Many Smart TV applications utilize grid-like layouts for content Browse (e.g., app launchers, movie carousels).
Traditional web navigation models often fall short in this context, leading to frustrating user experiences. This PoC aims to provide a solution that feels natural and efficient for TV users.

Features & Highlights
This PoC showcases the following key aspects of effective spatial navigation:

Predictable Focus Movement: Users can reliably anticipate where their focus will move when pressing directional buttons, even across irregularly shaped or spaced elements.
Edge Case Handling: Addresses common complexities such as:
Skipping Elements: How to handle navigation when there's no direct "next" element in a given direction.
Focus Traps: Preventing the user from getting stuck in a subset of elements.
Dynamic Content: Adapting navigation as elements are added or removed from the DOM.
Customizable Focus Logic: The underlying navigation logic is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various UI layouts and specific navigation requirements.
No External Dependencies (Pure JavaScript/HTML/CSS): This PoC is built with standard web technologies, making it easy to integrate and understand.
Clear Visual Focus Indicator: Demonstrates how to provide prominent and easily discernible visual feedback for the currently focused element.
How it Works (Briefly)
The core of this spatial navigation system relies on:

Element Identification: Identifying all focusable elements within the UI.
Bounding Box Calculations: Determining the top, left, width, and height of each focusable element.
Directional Algorithms: Implementing algorithms that, given a current focus and a desired direction (Up, Down, Left, Right), calculate the "best" next focusable element based on proximity and alignment. This often involves concepts like "closest element in direction" or "overlap percentage."
Getting Started
To run this PoC locally:

Clone this repository: git clone [repository_url]
Navigate to the project directory: cd [your-repo-name]
Open index.html in your web browser.
You can then use your keyboard's arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to simulate remote control input and observe the spatial navigation in action.

Contributions & Future Enhancements
This PoC serves as a starting point. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute! Potential areas for improvement or expansion include:

Integration with specific Smart TV frameworks (e.g., WebOS, Tizen, Android TV).
Adding support for circular navigation or "wrap-around" behavior.
Implementing more advanced "snapping" or "prioritization" logic for complex layouts.
Performance optimizations for UIs with a very large number of focusable elements.
Accessibility considerations for users with different needs.
